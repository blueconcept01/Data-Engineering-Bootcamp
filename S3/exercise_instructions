In this S3 exercise, we will access the AWS s3 service using python and boto3.

boto3 - Boto3 is the name of the Python SDK for AWS. It allows you to directly create, update, and delete AWS resources from your Python scripts.

Please refer the document 'doc_to_setup_programmatic_access_boto.docx' to setup boto3 and access credentials in python. After this document, you should have the
access key and secret key that we will be using to setup the connection between python and AWS s3 service.

We can use use boto3 to access AWS services.We will be implementing the following python files that will interact with S3 services in AWS -

1. s3-create-bucket.py - this python file shows you how to create s3 bucket in AWS using python boto3.
2. s3-upload-file.py   - this python file shows you how to upload objects to s3 bucket in AWS using python boto3.
3. s3-list-all-objects.py - this python file shows you how to list all files from s3 bucket in AWS using python boto3.
4. s3-delete-file.py - this python file shows you how to delete an object/file/folder from s3 bucket in AWS using python boto3.
5. s3-list-buckets.py - this python file shows you how to list all the s3 buckets available in AWS using python boto3.
6. s3-delete-bucket.py - this python file shows you how to destroy a s3 bucket in AWS using python boto3.

I have added comments in the python files.
