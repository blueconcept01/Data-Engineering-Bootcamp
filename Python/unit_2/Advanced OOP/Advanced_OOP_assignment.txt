Please implement the functions for Advanced_OOP.py.

Below are the functions that you will be implementing in the python file using OOPs.

1. create_update_class_student

The function will be doing the following:
1. Create a class `Student` with attributes `student_name` and `marks`.
2. Create a object of class with the parameter1.
3. Update the `marks` of the student object with the parameter2.
4. Return the latest details.

2. get_fare_vehicle

The function will be doing the following -

1. Create class vehicle with the attributes name, mileage and capacity.
2. Create method `fare` in class vehicle that calulates the fare as 'capacity*100'
3. Create object of class Vehicle with the input list.
4. Return the fare for the given capacity.

3. create_bus_inherit_class

This is based on Class Inheritence.

The function will be doing the following -

1. Create class Vehicle with the attributes name, max_speed and mileage.
2. Create class Bus that will inherit class vehicle.
3. Create object of class Bus with the input list and return the name attribute of the Bus object.

4. get_bus_fare

This is based on Class Inheritence.

The function will be doing the following -

1. Create class Vehicle with the attributes name, mileage and capacity.
2. Create method `fare` in class Vehicle that calulates the fare as 'capacity*100'
3. Create class Bus that will inherit class Vehicle.
4. Create method `fare` in class Vehicle that will inherit the super class method and add the 10% maintainence charges. So total 
fare for bus instance will become the final amount = total fare + 10% of the total fare.
3. Create object of class Bus with the input list.
4. Return the fare for the given capacity.

5. get_rectangle_area

The function will be doing the following -

1. Create class Rectangle with the attributes length and width.
2. Create method `rectangle_area` in class Rectangle that calulates the area.
3. Create object of class Rectangle with the input.
4. Return the rectangle_area.

6. get_area_perimeter_circle

The function will be doing the following -

1. Create class Circle with the attribute radius.
2. Create two method `area` and `perimeter` in class Circle that calulates the area and perimeter of circle.
3. Create object of class Circle with the input.
4. Return the area and perimeter in a list.

Keep in mind, these functions require prior knowledge of prior lessons, if you don't know how to implement these functions
ask for help or review prior lessons.
