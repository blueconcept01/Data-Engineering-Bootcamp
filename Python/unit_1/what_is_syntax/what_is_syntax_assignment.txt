Assignment 1

Run hello_world.py at least once.
To do this either press the play button on Visual Studio Code (VSC) or type:

python3 hello_worlds.py

You should see:

helloworld!
this is command 2
this is command 3
My name is
Jack Tran

Assignment 2

Your name isn't Jack Tran so lets change Jack Tran to your own name.  
Edit the file so Jack Tran is replaced by your name.  
Then save and run the code the same way as in Assignment 1.

helloworld!
this is command 2
this is command 3
My name is
[Your Name Here]

Note:

To Run Python code, setup VSC, please refer back to the last lesson and the introduction to command line
