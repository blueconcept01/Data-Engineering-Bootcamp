Please implement the functions for Iterators.py.

Below is the function that you will be implementing in the python file.

1. string_iterator

Write a function to create a iterater to iterate through the string. And the return the characters in a list.
Make use of iterator methods __next__ and __iter__.

You will be doing the following:
1. Create Iterator class, and define the respective methods __init__, __iter__ and __next__.
2. Create object of Iterator class with the input string.
3. Return the characters in a list.

If the given string is empty, return -1.

For example: For string "abc", the output should be ['a', 'b', 'c']

2. number_iterator

Write a function to create an iterator that returns numbers in a list, starting with 1 to the given number n.
Make use of iterator methods __next__ and __iter__.

You will be doing the following:
1. Create MyNumbers class, and define the respective methods __init__, __iter__ and __next__.
2. Create object of MyNumbers class with the input number n.
3. Return the numbers in a list, starting with 1 to the given number n.

If the given number is less than 1, return -1.

For example: For number 4, the output should be [1, 2, 3, 4]

3. odd_number_iterator

Write a function to create an iterator that returns the odd numbers in a list, starting with 1 to the given number n.
Make use of iterator methods __next__ and __iter__.

You will be doing the following:
1. Create OddNumbers class, and define the respective methods __init__, __iter__ and __next__.
2. Create object of OddNumbers class with the input number n.
3. Return the odd numbers in a list, starting with 1 to the given number n.

If the given number is less than 1, return -1.

For example: For number 4, the output should be [1, 3]

4. even_number_iterator

Write a function to create an iterator that returns the even numbers in a list, starting with 1 to the given number n.
Make use of iterator methods __next__ and __iter__.

You will be doing the following:
1. Create EvenNumbers class, and define the respective methods __init__, __iter__ and __next__.
2. Create object of EvenNumbers class with the input number n.
3. Return the even numbers in a list, starting with 1 to the given number n.

If the given number is less than 1, return -1.

For example: For number 4, the output should be [2, 4]

5. reverse_string_generator

Write a function to create a generator to reverse a string.
Make use of generator yield.

You will be doing the following:
1. Create a function rev_str, and generate the reversed string using yield and for loop.
2. Call the function rev_str and return the reversed string.

If the given string is empty, return -1.

For example: For string "abc", the output should be "cba".

Keep in mind, these functions require prior knowledge of prior lessons, if you don't know how to implement these functions
ask for help or review prior lessons.
