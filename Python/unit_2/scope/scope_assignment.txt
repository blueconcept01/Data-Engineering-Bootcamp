Please implement the functions for scope.py.

Below is the function that you will be implementing in the python file.

1. variable_scope

Concept: Variable Scope. If there are two variable with same name, then its scope is defined by the block. 
If its inside a function, then its scope is within the function. 

You will perform the following:
1. Define a variable `a` with value p1.
2. Create a function name `check` and inside the function define a varibale `a` with value p2. 
And add a return statement to return the variable `a`.
3. return the variable `a`, and function `check`.

You will notice that function `check` will return the value of `a` as p2, not as p1.

Keep in mind, these functions require prior knowledge of prior lessons, if you don't know how to implement these functions
ask for help or review prior lessons.
