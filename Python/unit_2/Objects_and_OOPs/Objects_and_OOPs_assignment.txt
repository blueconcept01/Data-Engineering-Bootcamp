Please implement the functions for Objects_and_OOPs.py.

Below are the functions that you will be implementing in the python file using OOPs.

1. create_dog_class

The function will do the following -
1. Create a class `Dog` with the attributes breed, color, age, and name. 
2. Create the object of the `Dog` class with the input list.
3. Return the attribute breed of the object.

2. create_vehicle_class

The function will do the following -
1. Create a Vehicle class with max_speed and mileage instance attributes. 
2. Create the object of the `Vehicle` class with the input 
3. Return the attribute mileage of the object.

3. get_fare_vehicle

The function will do the following -
1. Create class vehicle with the attributes name, mileage and capacity.
2. Create method `fare` in class vehicle that calulates the fare as 'capacity*100'
3. Create object of class Vehicle with the input list.
4. Return the fare for the given capacity.

4. create_bus_inherit_class

This is based on Class Inheritence.

The function will do the following -
1. Create class Vehicle with the attributes name, max_speed and mileage.
2. Create class Bus that will inherit class vehicle.
3. Create object of class Bus with the input list and return the name attribute of the Bus object.

5. get_bus_fare

This is based on Class Inheritence.

The function will do the following -
1. Create class Vehicle with the attributes name, mileage and capacity.
2. Create method `fare` in class Vehicle that calulates the fare as 'capacity*100'
3. Create class Bus that will inherit class Vehicle.
4. Create method `fare` in class Vehicle that will inherit the super class method and add the 10% maintainence charges. So total 
fare for bus instance will become the final amount = total fare + 10% of the total fare.
5. Create object of class Bus with the input list.
6. Return the fare for the given capacity.

Keep in mind, these functions require prior knowledge of prior lessons, if you don't know how to implement these functions
ask for help or review prior lessons.
